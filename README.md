Miracle: 
1. vue init webpack frontend
2.npm install --save axios   for ajax call
3 npm install --save btoa body-parser express mongoose multer  
btoa: this will help us create a unique hash for a file so we can have a URL shortner functionality.
body-parser: this makes it easy for the backend to access parameters from the frontend.
express: this is the main backend framework built on top of Node.js
mongoose: this is an ORM library. It helps to insert and manipulate data using a MongoDB database.
multer: this is a library which allows us to receive and store files in the backend.
